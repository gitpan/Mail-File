Revision history for Perl module Mail::File.

0.08	02/03/2007
	- Added Time::Piece to the mix to ensure we have a valid date written
	  to the file to conform to the Internet Mail RFC specs.
	- Directory created only when we "send" the mail to disk. Also now
	  checks we have created the directory before writing the file.
	- Refined tests.
	- Handwritten META.yml to conform to current specs.
	- Changed all instances of LICENCE to LICENSE.
	- Added META.yml test script.
	- Added LICENSE and Artistic files.
	- Added an examples directory. Nothing in it yet, except a request
	  for interesting scripts.
	- POD/README updates
	- Devel::Cover - 99.2%

0.07	21/03/2005
	- more tests to fill the holes Devel::Cover found.

0.04  Tue Oct 28 13:41:16 GMTDT 2003
	- extracated the cpan-testing directory out of Mail-File. This is now
	  going to be a special distribution of it's own.
	- Message now Body.
	- X-Headers can be passed via the hash.
	- sprintf overhead removed ... no idea why I did that!

0.03  Wed Oct  8 13:04:18 GMTDT 2003

0.02  Tue Oct  7 17:37:44 GMTDT 2003
	- cpan-testing files updated to use /.smoke/mailfiles 
	  for reports directory.
	- removed move-mailfiles.pl as the change above renders
	  it obsolete.
	- Mail::File creates the directory of the template (if
	  there is one) if it can.
